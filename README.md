# Base Experiments

This is the shared library behind several experiments. You should clone this 
repository locally, `cd` into it, then install with `pip install -e .`.
If you have a catkin workspace, you should clone to its `src` directory and
install it with `catkin build`. This will allow rviz to correctly find the
meshes for visualization (only needed for real robot experiments).
